--- === NeverLoseFocus ===
---
--- Whenever you close or minimize the last visible window of a macOS
--- application, that application is still active, even though some
--- other application's window might now be the frontmost window.
---
--- - This Spoon tracks window focus and unfocus events to ensure
---   that you're never without focus!
---
--- - When the last visible window of an application is closed or
---   minimized, this Spoon will focus the next most recently used
---   and still-visible application's window.
---
--- - This Spoon's behavior emulates the window-centric behaviour of
---   Linux and Windows, and eschews the app-centric macOS paradigm.
---
---   - The Apple approach, in this author's opinion, is a remnant of
---     System 6 and before's single-tasking model. That is, early
---     macOS won't switch apps unless you quit one app and start another;
---     and with System 7 onwards, macOS won't switch apps even when
---     you close the last application window ‚Äî indeed, you'll still
---     see the application's menu bar, sans application windows
---     (though some other app's window might now be the frontmost
---     window, albeit without focus... which I still find strange!).
---
---     Which I sorta get, because macOS attaches the menu bar to the
---     top of the display, disconnected from any application window.
---
---     This is in contrast to Linux or Windows, where each application
---     window has its own menu bar.
---
---   - But if you like to hide the macOS menu bar (I do!), it can be
---     confusing when you close the last app window, some other app's
---     window is now topmost, yet you cannot interact with it! (FYI,
---     I use a GeekTool geeklet to display the time on my Desktop, in
---     the exact position where the macOS menu bar clock would appear;
---     and otherwise I almost exclusively use keyboard shortcuts to
---     interact with my apps, so that I rarely use the menu bar.) (Also
---     I hide the Dock and mostly use Hammerspoon bindings and the
---     occassional Spotlight Search to switch between apps and windows.)
---
---   - So here you have it, just one culty Linux dev's Spoon to help
---     make their macOS host basically just another Linux distro.
---
---     - See also my other Hammerspoon and Karabiner Elements config,
---       and `defaults write ... NSUserKeyEquivalents` project,
---       in furtherance of the same goal:
---
---         https://github.com/DepoXy/macOS-onboarder#üèÇ
---         https://github.com/DepoXy/macOS-Hammyspoony#ü•Ñ
---         https://github.com/DepoXy/Karabiner-Elephants#üêò
---
--- - ALTLY: Without this Spoon, another approach is to <Cmd-H> hide
---   the app after closing/minimizing last visible window, thereby
---   focusing whatever window is topmost (but that doesn't have focus).

--- DUNNO/2024-10-01: Sometimes when I open and close Chrome windows fastly,
--- the events don't register, or visibleWindows() reports multiple when
--- there are non, and focus won't switch.
--- - I'm not quite sure how to fix this, other than maybe trying to listen on
---   other or additional events (albeit looking at the list of subscribable
---   events, I'm not sure what else I could hook, e.g., hiding an app (which
---   should signal windowHidden) will also trigger windowUnfocused, which we
---   listen on below).
---   - Fortunately, if you actually linger on a window for a little before
---     closing it (and don't open-close it immediately), this doesn't seem
---     to happen.
